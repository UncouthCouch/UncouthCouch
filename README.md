Hello! I'm Jeff, @UncouthCouch, an aspiring IT professional. My current focus is on learning scripting languages that will be helpful in the IT world, such as Powershell and Python.
Any scripts that I create for uses both common and niche will be readily and freely available on this GitHub profile. 

To start, the repository Powershell-Scripts is available and has functioning scripts. Naming conventions will be the verb function (Search_, Run_, Backup_, Create_, etc) followed by whatever action the script will take. Certain scripts will begin with the platform it is meant for, such as Azure_. This is meant to help navigate the scripts and find what you may be looking for more easily.
