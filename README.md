Hello! I'm Jeff, @UncouthCouch, an aspiring IT professional. My current focus is on learning scripting languages that will be helpful in the IT world, such as Powershell and Python.
Any scripts that I create for uses both common and niche will be readily and freely available on this GitHub profile.
